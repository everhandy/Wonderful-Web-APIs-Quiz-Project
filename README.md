The purpose of this project was to create a timed coding quiz with multiple choice questions that allows users to test their knowledge in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Web APIs. This application runs in the web browser using dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I wrote from scratch.
